# Apache Synapse Go Implementation

Welcome to the developer documentation for the Apache Synapse Go implementation. This documentation is designed for developers who want to understand, use, or contribute to the Synapse Go codebase.

## What is Apache Synapse?

Apache Synapse is a lightweight and high-performance Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) and mediation engine. This project reimplements the core functionality of Apache Synapse in Go, bringing the benefits of Go's performance characteristics and concurrency model to the Synapse ecosystem.

## Key Features

- **Hexagonal Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns with ports and adapters
- **Artifact Deployment**: Dynamic loading and deployment of integration artifacts
- **Inbound Endpoints**: Support for HTTP and File inbound endpoints
- **API Management**: REST API support with CORS and Swagger documentation
- **Mediation**: Message mediation through sequences and mediators
- **Configuration Management**: Dynamic configuration with live reload

## Documentation Structure

This documentation is organized into several sections:

- **Architecture**: Details about the hexagonal architecture implementation, application lifecycle, and context management
- **Core Components**: Documentation for major system components like configuration, logging, inbound endpoints, and API handling
- **API Reference**: Technical reference for the core APIs
- **Contributing**: Guidelines for contributing to the project
